# drum-kit

A simple drum kit you can play using your keyboard and mouse.

Must run in a browser that natively supports ES6 and the ECMAscript module syntax.

This is project 1 of Wes Bos' free [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course, which I am using to review and improve my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and browser APIs and using them to build simple projects without using any frameworks or libraries.
